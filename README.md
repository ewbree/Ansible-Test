# Ansible-Test

For mere ansible tests and studies on local VMs.

## Self documentation

Notes to myself since I am 100% sure I will forget about this stuff after X amount of time since I don't work much with Ansible myself yet.
It'll come with the time though since network automation allows for it more.

### files:

inventory = hosts
ansible.cfg = Ansible's configuration specifically to the working directory


## old_files:
This folder contains just the old stuff I worked on. I start anew with this new commit now.
